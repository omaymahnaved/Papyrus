            <h1>Ma'am Wajiha Siddique</h1>
            <p>Teachers are a special blessing from God to us. They are the ones who build a good nation and make the world a better place. A teacher teaches us the importance of a pen over that of a sword. They are much esteemed in society as they elevate the living standards of people.
            A teacher is a great listener of knowledge, prosperity, and light, from which we can benefit greatly throughout our life. Every teacher helps their students in choosing their path. Teachers teach their students how to respect elders. They tell their students the difference between respect and insult and many more.
            "Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together."</p>
