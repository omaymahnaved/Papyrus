            <p>Computer programmers work independently as part of larger software teams. Together with software developers and engineers, programmers create the instructions computers use to execute tasks. A programmer's job also includes finding bugs, eliminating errors, and troubleshooting issues.
            (April 2021) Computer programming is the process of telling a computer to do certain things by giving it instructions. These instructions are called programs. A person who writes instructions is a computer programmer. The instructions come in different programming languages, like C++ or Java.
            Programming is important for a variety of reasons. It helps us automate tasks, create new technologies, and develop more efficient systems. With the ever-growing importance of technology in our world, learning to program is becoming more and more essential.</p>
